      <h2> Gordo's Love for food</h2>

Eventually Gordo left and went to college and some how ended up at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Crazy, I know!

     <h3> Gordo Needs Ingredients</h3>
     Gordo begins his journey for cajun food by going to the most obscure grocery store, <strong>Walmart</strong>. Gordo needs quite the sum of ingredients for his first dish, <em>dirty rice</em>, so he makes a list of ingredients.

         <li> Beef Broth</li>
         <li> Chopped Green Onion</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Time to Cook</h3>
         Gordo begins to execute the instructions that he remembered his mother doing.
         <ol>
             <li>Add ground beef to a dutch oven or heavy bottomed pan set over medium heat. Crumble with a spatula and cook 4-5 minutes until no pink remains.</li>

             <li>Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Garnish with green onions before serving.</li>
         </ol>
